        text: `At the dawn of time, when the universe was just
                beginning to exist, there was one primordial
                element — Thonium. This element was the
                embodiment of pure energy and matter,
                maintaining the harmony and stability of all
                things. Its power and energy permeated every
                corner of the cosmos, shaping the laws
                of physics and creating the basis for life. But
                one day something incredible happened —
                a cataclysm that changed the course of history
                forever.`,

        text: `Thonium, possessing infinite energy, entered
                into an unstable interaction with the
                environment. As a result of this interaction,
                subatomic particles began to oscillate, leading
                to a cascading quantum explosion. In a flash
                of unprecedented power, Thonium disintegrated
                into 118 separate elements. These elements
                scattered throughout the universe, creating new
                planets and forming the basis for diverse life
                forms.`,

                one of the elements that can be collected and
                used. These elements became the building blocks
                for civilizations, technologies and cultures.`,

                beginning. Recreating the original element
                Thonium is possible, but to do this
                it is necessary to collect seven special
                elements. Every day, Toniy changes his internal
                code, and to recreate it, seven new elements
                must be found.`,

                value, but also real value. Once you collect it,
                you can exchange Thonium on the market for real
                currency — the TON cryptocurrency, at the rate
                of 1 Thonium to 1 TON. This opens up endless
                possibilities for players, turning virtual
                achievements into real value.`,
